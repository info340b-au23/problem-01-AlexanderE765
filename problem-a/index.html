        is a character in the DC Universe who uses his powers of super speed to save people from disasters
        as quick as possible. He could even run to the past and future. There are multiple Flash's in the 
        Universe, but the main one we follow today is Barry Allen, a Forensic Scientist, known for his 
        humor and nerdiness, and his deep liking of Iris West. When he was younger, his Mother was murdered 
        by a villian called the Reverse Flash who ran back in time teach Barry how to use his new powers and 
        build them up, so he could take them and become the fastest thing in the Universe. Barry goes back in
        time to stop this from happening and messes up the entire Universe in the process. This was the only time
        he had ever done something selfish, as he always is trying help other people.
